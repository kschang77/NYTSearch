# NYTSearch

NYTSearch is an "intro to API integration" web app where users can enter a search term and query the _New York Times_ archive by setting year limits. 

The app itself was of little interest. However, I was able to incorporate JQueryValidate into the app to handle data field validations and works as a good demo case on how to use JQueryValidation on future projects. 

Visual work was done by Nadine Bundschuh with some participation by Rand Hunt. Backend and validation by Kasey Chang.
